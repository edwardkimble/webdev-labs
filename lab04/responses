1. SQL Alchemy is valuable in that it makes communication with databases easier. It does so by being database agnostic, and introducing Object Relational Mapping (ORM).

2. Models in SQL Alchemy are baseclasses. It is an ORM that issues SQL "queries under-the-hood," allowing you to interact with data such as tables in an easier way.

3. A view is basically a representation of a resource in REST. In our case, each has a List and Detail resource, allowing us to create endpoints.
